  <h1>Title HTML</h1>

  <p> Tags p is for paragraf </p>

  <p> Word <em>em</em> do this with the words</p>

  <p>Word <strong>strong</strong> do this with the words</p>

  <p>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page — 
    they will appear on a new line from whatever content went before it, 
    and any content that goes after it will also appear on a new line. 
    Block-level elements tend to be structural elements on the page that represent, 
    for example, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, footers, etc. 
    A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, 
    but it might be nested inside another block-level element.
    Inline elements are those that are contained within block-level elements and surround only 
    small parts of the document’s content, not entire paragraphs and groupings of content. 
    An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document;
  </p>
  <p> look the code for the exemple above:</p>
  <em>first</em><em>second</em><em>third</em>
  <p>fourth</p><p>fifth</p><p>sixth</p>

  <h1>Atribute</h1>

  <p>An attribute should have:
  <ol>
     <li> A space between it and the element name 
          (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes.)</li>
      <li>The attribute name, followed by an equals sign.</li>
      <li>An attribute value, with opening and closing quote marks wrapped around it.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <!-- In HTML, the characters <,>,",' and & are special characters. 
  They are parts of the HTML syntax itself, so how do you include one of these characters in your text, 
  for example if you really want to use an ampersand or less than sign, and not have it interpreted as code as some browsers may do?
  We have to use character references — special codes that represent characters, 
  and can be used in these exact circumstances. 
  Each character reference is started with an ampersand (&), and ended by a semicolon (;).
